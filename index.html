      <img src="assets/images/cat.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>Hey there!  My name is Colin Kramer.  I am a University of Minnesota graduate, with a bachelor of arts in political science.  I am currently a student in the University of Minnesota coding bootcamp.  I am enjoying a great opportunity to learn a mountain of information about web development.  I hope to use these skills to eventually find gainful and rewarding employment in the tech world.</p>

      <p>The best part of my life is my 12 year old son Aiden.  He is brilliant, thoughtful, handsome, motivated, and just as funny as me!  He likes playing video games, making youtube videos, reading, playing with his friends and sisters, and in general being awesome.  Together we have fun playing video games, playing mini-golf, watching cartoons and movies, and lots of other cool things.</p>

      <p>Besides taking the bootcamp course, I am spending my summer working part-time at both Golf Galaxy (as a cashier) and Applewood Hills Golf Course (as a pro-shop guy and bartender.)  In my freetime I like spending my time with friends and family, playing golf, reading about Mt. Everest, cheering for Gopher sports, making jokes, and sleeping.</p>
